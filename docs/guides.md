## Upgrading

```bash
uv tool upgrade ccgram                # uv (recommended)
pipx upgrade ccgram                   # pipx
brew upgrade ccgram                   # Homebrew
```

Restart the running bot after upgrading, and check `ccgram --version`. If the bot runs from a development checkout, also upgrade the global executable used by agent hooks. A hook that invokes bare `ccgram` uses the agent's `PATH`, independently of the bot's installation; see [protocol compatibility](#protocol-version-pinning).

### Upgrading from 4.10 to 4.11

- Remove `--autoclose-done`, `--autoclose-dead`, `AUTOCLOSE_DONE_MINUTES`, and `AUTOCLOSE_DEAD_MINUTES` from launch commands and configuration. Confirmed terminal-session closure now triggers topic and history deletion without a grace timer.
- Keep **Delete Messages** enabled for the bot administrator. **Manage Topics** alone only permits closing a topic, which leaves it visible.
- Run `/sync` to retry cleanup of locally known old topics. Topics whose IDs are no longer recorded cannot be discovered through the Bot API.
- Use `--unbound-window-ttl` / `UNBOUND_WINDOW_TTL_MINUTES` only for inactive terminal windows without a topic binding; it does not delay topic deletion.

```

## Getting Started

### Platform Support

CCGram supports Linux, macOS, and WSL2. Native Windows is not supported. The agterm backend is macOS-native.

On Windows, install and run CCGram inside WSL2. Install the multiplexer and agent CLI inside the WSL distribution; use agterm only on macOS.

### BotFather Setup

You need a Telegram bot token to run CCGram. Create one via [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).

1. **Open [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)** on Telegram and send `/start`
2. **Create a new bot:** Send `/newbot` and follow the prompts
   - Name: anything (e.g., "MyCodeBot")
   - Username: must be unique and end with `bot` (e.g., "my_code_bot")
   - You'll receive a **Bot Token** — save this for `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`
3. **Configure bot settings:** Send `/mybots` → select your bot → **Bot Settings**.
   - Enable **Topics** for a private-chat setup.
   - Enable **Allow Groups** for a group setup.
   - Disable **Group Privacy** so the bot can read all group-topic messages.
4. **Choose a topic setup:**
   - **Private chat:** Open the bot chat. Topic 1 is the General/control topic.
   - **Group:** Create or open a Topics-enabled group. Add the bot and promote it to Administrator with Manage Topics, Delete Messages, and Pin Messages permissions. Delete Messages is required to remove a topic and its history; Manage Topics alone is insufficient.
5. **Get your user ID:** Open [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot). Save the numeric ID for `ALLOWED_USERS`.
6. **For a group, get its ID:** Open [@RawDataBot](https://t.me/RawDataBot) in the group. Save the Peer ID for `CCGRAM_GROUP_ID`. Both forms with and without the `-100` prefix work.
7. **Create `~/.ccgram/.env`:**

   ```ini
   TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
   ALLOWED_USERS=your_user_id_here
   # Group setup only:
   CCGRAM_GROUP_ID=your_group_id_here
   ```

8. **Test:** Run `ccgram`. Create a topic in the configured chat and send a message. The directory browser must appear.

### Validation

Run `ccgram doctor` at any time to validate your setup:

```bash
ccgram doctor         # Check configuration, hooks, multiplexer, agent CLIs
ccgram doctor --fix   # Auto-fix common issues (install hooks, kill orphans, etc.)
```

## Herdr guarded-session migration

Herdr topics use `agent.list` as their sole identity source. CCGram stores only an opaque `herdr-session-v1-…` target; tabs, panes, terminal IDs, names, directories, and focus are live locators, not topic identity. Each action takes a fresh snapshot and fails closed when its target is missing, duplicate, malformed, or sessionless.

Existing Herdr tab/pane/terminal bindings are marked `legacy_herdr` and blocked. Use `/unbind` to archive the CCGram binding without closing the Herdr session; rollback can restore that record but it remains blocked. Send a message in the topic and explicitly choose a listed session target to rebind. CCGram never guesses a migration target from a name or reusable locator. If an old tab binding now covers several agents, it remains blocked while each live session surfaces as a new pane-qualified topic. Archive the historical binding with `/unbind`, or explicitly rebind it to one selected session; CCGram never chooses for you.

A session can change after the fresh guard and before Herdr receives an action. CCGram records that post-guard dispatch race and does not claim atomic delivery. Run live Herdr tests only against a disposable server and redact target/session evidence.

### Shared tabs and topic names

Herdr exposes one Telegram topic for each agent session, not one topic for each
tab. Every generated name is `<Provider> ▸ <workspace> ▸ <tab> ▸ <pane>`,
including a tab that currently has one agent. If Herdr has not published labels
yet, the temporary display name is `<Provider> ▸ Herdr ▸ <target-suffix>`. The
provider prefix makes agent topics searchable; the pane suffix distinguishes
siblings without flapping when siblings join or leave. Both remain display
state rather than identity and can change when Herdr updates its live labels.

Telegram topic rename is disabled for shared tabs because Herdr's tab rename
would rename every sibling. Rename the Herdr tab directly only when its tab has
one agent; the next reconciliation updates the topic name. If Herdr reports the
same session target more than once, CCGram quarantines only that target and
keeps unrelated topics operational.

## Local Dev in agterm

Set `CCGRAM_MULTIPLEXER=agterm` to use [agterm](https://github.com/umputun/agterm) as the session backend. agterm is macOS-native. Install `agtermctl` from agterm's **Help > Install Command Line Tool**, start agterm, and make sure that `agtermctl` can reach its control socket. Set `AGTERM_SOCKET` when the default control-socket path is not the one to use.

Set `CCGRAM_AGTERM_WORKSPACES` to a comma-separated list of workspace names.
Use `*` to include all workspaces. CCGram shows the workspace picker when agterm
supports workspace selection, and it uses the selected workspace for new sessions.

Agterm reports session state through its native status field. Provider detection
uses foreground argv when agterm cannot provide a process-group ID. CCGram does
not subscribe to agterm events, so status and transcript updates use polling.

Run the standard unit and integration checks before deployment. Run live agterm
checks only against a disposable agterm instance.

## Local Dev in tmux

Recommended local development model:

- Run ccgram in a dedicated control window `ccgram:__main__`.
- Keep agent windows in the same `ccgram` tmux session.
- Restart by sending Ctrl-C to the control pane.

Use the helper script:

```bash
./scripts/restart.sh start      # fresh start; creates ccgram:__main__ if missing and installs Claude hooks
./scripts/restart.sh status     # show current command + last logs
./scripts/restart.sh restart    # sends Ctrl-C to control pane (supervisor restarts)
./scripts/restart.sh stop       # sends Ctrl-\ to control pane (supervisor exits)
```

Direct key behavior in the control pane (`ccgram:__main__`):

- `Ctrl-C`: restart ccgram.
- `Ctrl-\`: stop the local dev supervisor loop.

### Fresh Start Guide

If you are starting from scratch:

1. `cd /path/to/ccgram`
2. `./scripts/restart.sh start`
3. `tmux attach -t ccgram`
4. In another terminal (or another pane), open your agent windows in the same tmux session.

The `start` command creates the tmux session/window if they do not exist, installs or updates Claude hooks, and then launches the supervisor. No manual tmux bootstrap is required.

## Testing

CCGram has three test tiers:

| Tier        | Command                 | Time     | Requirements      |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| Unit        | `make test`             | ~10s     | None (all mocked) |
| Integration | `make test-integration` | ~7s      | tmux              |
| E2E         | `make test-e2e`         | ~3-4 min | tmux + agent CLIs |

`make check` runs unit + integration tests together with formatting, linting, and type checking.

### E2E Tests

End-to-end tests exercise the full lifecycle: inject fake Telegram updates → real PTB application → real tmux windows → real agent CLI processes → intercept Bot API responses. Each provider's tests are skipped automatically if its CLI is not installed.

**Prerequisites:**

- tmux installed and in PATH
- One or more agent CLIs installed and authenticated: `claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `pi`

**Test coverage per provider:**

| Provider | Tests | Scenarios                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Claude   | 9     | Lifecycle, `/sessions`, `/screenshot`, `/help` forwarding, recovery (fresh + continue), status transitions, multi-topic isolation, notification mode cycling |
| Codex    | 3     | Lifecycle, command forwarding, recovery                                                                                                                      |
| Gemini   | 3     | Lifecycle, command forwarding, recovery                                                                                                                      |
| Pi       | —     | Unit + contract coverage only; no e2e lifecycle suite yet                                                                                                    |

**How it works:** The Bot API HTTP layer is mocked — fake `Update` objects are injected via `app.process_update()` and all outgoing API calls are intercepted and recorded for assertions. The tests drive through the full topic binding flow (directory browser → optional worktree picker → provider picker → mode select → window creation) and verify agent processes launch, messages are forwarded, and responses are delivered.

**Running:**

```bash
make test-e2e                                         # All providers
uv run pytest tests/e2e/test_claude_lifecycle.py -v   # Claude only
uv run pytest tests/e2e/test_codex_lifecycle.py -v    # Codex only
uv run pytest tests/e2e/test_gemini_lifecycle.py -v   # Gemini only
# Pi: covered by unit + contract tests in tests/ccgram/providers/test_pi.py
```

The tests create an isolated `ccgram-e2e` tmux session that does not interfere with a running `ccgram` instance. Safe to run from a tmux window.

## Configuration

All settings accept both CLI flags and environment variables. CLI flags take precedence. `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` is env-only for security (flags are visible in `ps`).

## Topic Emoji Color Scheme

Topic emojis change color to reflect agent status. The mapping between color and meaning is configurable:

| Mode               | 🟢 Green                        | 🟡 Yellow        | When to pick                       |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `system` (default) | agent is working                | agent is idle    | "is anything running right now?"   |
| `user`             | agent is idle / ready for input | agent is working | "does anything need my attention?" |

Set globally via `CCGRAM_STATUS_MODE=user` or `--status-mode user`. Invalid values fall back to `system`.

## Status Bubble Visibility

Status bubbles show transient progress, elapsed time, task state, and toolbar controls.
Set `CCGRAM_HIDE_STATUS=true` to suppress those bubbles. This does not hide agent
replies, approval prompts, recovery notices, or the `/toolbar` command.

## Tool-Call Visibility

By default, `tool_use` and `tool_result` events from Claude/Codex/Gemini are forwarded to Telegram. You can suppress them globally or per-window when they create more noise than signal (e.g., during heavy file or grep work).

- **Global**: `CCGRAM_HIDE_TOOL_CALLS=true` or `--hide-tool-calls` makes the global default `hidden`.
- **Per-window**: `/toolcalls` in a topic cycles `default → shown → hidden`. The per-window setting always wins over the global default.

Hook events (Stop, StopFailure, SubagentStart/Stop, TaskCompleted, TeammateIdle) are **never** suppressed — they bypass the gate so you still see what matters.

## Delivery, Backlog, and Jump to Live

### Lossless text batching

The outbound queue can combine consecutive eligible transcript text tasks into one Telegram message to reduce API calls. This is not the `/verbose` tool-call batching mode: `/verbose` controls the separate live tool-use display.

A text batch is eligible only when every item is a non-empty, one-part text task with the same **chat, topic/thread, window, role, and transcript source session**. CCGram stops at the first different or ineligible queued item, so it never crosses chats, topics, windows, roles, sessions, tool updates, status updates, media/TTS deliveries, or other queue boundaries. Batches are capped below Telegram's message limit and use a blank line between original items.

Each item is rendered to Telegram entities before the items are combined. Formatting opened in one item cannot alter the next item's formatting, and each item retains the formatting it would have had if sent on its own. This makes the batching lossless for eligible text while preserving the delivery boundaries of everything else.

### Queue progress and severe backlogs

The editable topic status bubble shows queue telemetry only for a severe backlog:

- **pending** — queued and in-flight transcript content items for that topic/window;
- **age** — how long the oldest of those items has waited; and
- **delivery lag** — the elapsed time for the latest completed content delivery (`—` until one completes).

These are in-memory progress metrics, so they reset when CCGram restarts. Healthy queue telemetry stays in structured service logs instead of the Telegram topic. A backlog is severe when it has **100 or more pending items** **or** its oldest item is **5 minutes (300 seconds) or older**. Only then does the status bubble show the queue line and its keyboard include **⏭ Jump to live**; the displayed severe-backlog text is throttled for up to 15 seconds.

### Confirmed jump semantics

**Jump to live** is an inline, two-step action: tap it, then tap **Confirm jump to live**. Cancel leaves the queue and all watermarks unchanged. On confirmation, CCGram snapshots the selected transcript source at its current EOF, persists a skip barrier before retiring only that source's queued range, and queues a visible notice such as `⏭ Skipped N queued transcript item(s) for live view (bytes A–B). Raw transcript retained.` New transcript bytes written after the snapshot are not part of the jump; an already in-flight send is also left alone rather than cancelled.

The raw provider transcript is retained; Jump to live does not delete or rewrite it. CCGram advances the durable delivered watermark past the skipped range only after Telegram acknowledges the skipped-range notice. If CCGram restarts or notice delivery fails first, it restores the barrier and retries the notice rather than silently advancing. Normal transcript relay is **at-least-once**, not exactly-once: a Telegram outcome that is not confirmed before a retry or restart can produce a duplicate message. This watermark policy favors retaining/replaying output over losing it.

## Thinking Visibility

By default, thinking messages are forwarded to Telegram. Set `CCGRAM_HIDE_THINKING=true` or use `--hide-thinking` to hide them globally.

This option does not hide responses, tool messages, or hook events. It has no per-window override.

## Voice Message Transcription

Send voice messages in Telegram and have them transcribed and forwarded to the agent.

### Setup

Set a whisper provider and API key:

```ini
# Groq (fast, generous free tier)
CCGRAM_WHISPER_PROVIDER=groq
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_xxxxxxxx

# Or OpenAI
CCGRAM_WHISPER_PROVIDER=openai
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxx

# Or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
CCGRAM_WHISPER_PROVIDER=openai
CCGRAM_WHISPER_API_KEY=your_key
CCGRAM_WHISPER_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/v1
```

Optional overrides:

```ini
CCGRAM_WHISPER_MODEL=whisper-large-v3-turbo   # default depends on provider
CCGRAM_WHISPER_LANGUAGE=en                     # omit for auto-detect
```

### How It Works

1. Send a voice message in a topic bound to an agent
2. Bot downloads the audio (max 25 MB) and sends it to the Whisper API
3. By default, the transcription appears with **✓ Send to agent** and **✗ Discard** buttons
4. Tap **Send** to forward the text to the agent, or **Discard** to cancel

Set `CCGRAM_VOICE_AUTOSEND=true` to skip the confirmation. The bot still posts the
transcription for review, then sends it through the same provider-aware path. This is
less safe for accidental or inaccurate dictation, so confirmation remains the default.

In shell topics, voice transcriptions are automatically routed through the LLM for command generation (if `CCGRAM_LLM_PROVIDER` is set). In agent topics, the transcribed text is sent directly to the agent.

Leave `CCGRAM_WHISPER_PROVIDER` empty (the default) to disable voice transcription.

## Tmux Session Auto-Detection

> This section applies when `CCGRAM_MULTIPLEXER=tmux` (the default). The herdr and agterm backends use their own workspace/session models and do not use a tmux session name.

When ccgram starts inside an existing tmux session, it auto-detects the session name and attaches to it instead of creating a new `ccgram` session. This is useful when you already have a tmux session with agent windows.

**How it works:**

1. If `$TMUX` is set and no `--tmux-session` flag is given, ccgram detects the current session name
2. The bot's own tmux window is automatically excluded from the window list
3. If another ccgram instance is already running in the same session, startup is refused

**Override:** `--tmux-session=NAME` or `TMUX_SESSION_NAME=NAME` always takes precedence over auto-detection.

**Outside tmux:** Behavior is unchanged — ccgram creates a `ccgram` session with a `__main__` placeholder window.

| Scenario                         | Behavior                                            |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Outside tmux, no flags           | Creates `ccgram` session + `__main__` window        |
| Outside tmux, `--tmux-session=X` | Creates/attaches `X` + `__main__` window            |
| Inside tmux, no flags            | Auto-detects session, skips own window, no creation |
| Inside tmux, `--tmux-session=X`  | Overrides auto-detect, uses `X`                     |

## Alternative Multiplexer Backends

ccgram talks to the terminal multiplexer through a backend-neutral seam. tmux is the default; [herdr](https://github.com/ogulcancelik/herdr) and [agterm](https://github.com/umputun/agterm) are opt-in alternatives selected with `CCGRAM_MULTIPLEXER=herdr` and `CCGRAM_MULTIPLEXER=agterm`, respectively. Backend capabilities differ; the backend-specific sections describe their user-visible constraints.

### Setup

1. **Install herdr** and make sure the `herdr` binary is in `PATH`. Start its server so the control socket exists.
2. **Select the backend:** set `CCGRAM_MULTIPLEXER=herdr` (env var or `.env`). The default is `tmux`.
3. **Socket path (optional):** ccgram reads `$HERDR_SOCKET_PATH` to find the server. Leave it unset to use herdr's default socket; set it to target a specific server.
4. **Install integrations and the ccgram hook:** for Pi, run `herdr integration install pi`, then start new Pi agents or restart existing ones so they load the integration and publish `agent_session`. Install the ccgram hook as usual with `ccgram hook --install`. The same Claude Code hook works on both backends — it resolves which window fired from `$HERDR_PANE_ID` (tmux uses `$TMUX_PANE`), so no herdr-specific hook step is required.
5. **Verify:** `ccgram doctor`. When `CCGRAM_MULTIPLEXER=herdr`, doctor checks the `herdr` binary, socket reachability, reported protocol version, and that ccgram's and herdr's own Claude hooks coexist in `settings.json` (instead of the tmux checks).

```bash
# .env or shell environment
CCGRAM_MULTIPLEXER=herdr
# HERDR_SOCKET_PATH=/path/to/herdr.sock   # optional; defaults to herdr's socket
```

### Protocol version pinning

CCGram accepts Herdr protocols 14–22 without warnings. Regular operations and provider-hook identity reads use the public newline-delimited JSON socket API, independently of the CLI's private wire protocol. This avoids `protocol_mismatch` failures after a package-manager update leaves an older server running. `HERDR_SOCKET_PATH` selects the endpoint directly; when unset, the CLI's read-only status command discovers the socket.

Readiness is checked with public `ping`. Unknown future protocol numbers warn but do not prevent compatible operations, and extra response fields are ignored. Missing identities, malformed responses, unavailable methods, and transport errors remain failures, never evidence that a session ended. Requests have bounded timeouts and frame sizes; mutation requests are not automatically replayed after a failure. A stopped or unreachable server still prevents startup. The Herdr CLI itself may still require a matching server for commands issued outside CCGram.

Hooks that invoke a bare `ccgram` use the executable on the agent's `PATH`, even when the bot runs from a development checkout. Upgrade that installation too (`uv tool upgrade ccgram` for a uv tool install). An old hook executable can create no session mapping while the newer bot still shows terminal status, leaving a topic without transcript messages. To bind Codex hooks to the checkout's interpreter instead, run `uv run ccgram hook --install --provider codex` from the checkout.

### Differences from tmux

herdr advertises its own capabilities through the seam; the behavioral consequences a user sees:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD060 -->

| Aspect                    | tmux                            | herdr                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Topic = agent session     | every window is eligible        | each reported agent session surfaces as one topic; a bare shell does not                              |
| Foreground detection      | `ps -t <tty>`                   | `pane process-info` (no tty)                                                                          |
| Scrollback capture        | unbounded                       | clamped to **1000 lines**; longer output is flagged as truncated                                      |
| Agent status              | inferred from terminal scraping | native (herdr reports agent status directly)                                                          |
| Window IDs across restart | stable                          | guarded session target is revalidated from fresh `agent.list`; ccgram never re-resolves a tab/pane ID |
| Topic labels              | window name                     | `<Provider> ▸ <workspace> ▸ <tab> ▸ <pane>` for every reported agent session                          |

Creating sessions from the terminal on herdr is covered in [Creating Sessions from the Terminal](#creating-sessions-from-the-terminal).

> **Workspace picker:** On herdr, `/new` shows an extra step after directory selection. Choose a workspace to pin the new tab there, or skip it: ccgram then explicitly creates a workspace from the requested directory and uses only its returned ID. It never infers the active or a matching workspace.
>
> **Self-hosting escape hatch:** Workspaces or tabs whose label matches `__*__` (e.g. `__main__`) are invisible to ccgram. Use this naming convention to run ccgram itself inside herdr without it auto-adopting its own terminal as a topic.

## Sync and Retired Topic Cleanup

`/sync` immediately deletes locally known topics whose terminal sessions are confirmed gone, retries pending deletions, and includes locally recorded topics that earlier versions closed without deleting. No extra **Fix** click is needed for this cleanup. It then reports the result and offers **Fix** for other repairable items. Each cleanup batch attempts up to 100 retired topics. Pending deletion records survive restarts and are never dropped by the separate 100-entry retained-history limit.

Before each removal, CCGram rechecks the exact chat/topic binding. A topic that is active or was rebound in the meantime is protected from deletion. A new binding for the same chat/topic also removes the old retired record. If the multiplexer cannot provide an authoritative listing, `/sync` performs no cleanup.

`CCGRAM_AUTODELETE_DEAD_TOPICS=false` only gates the automatic per-tick dead-session deletion. A topic kept that way is still a binding pointing at a confirmed-dead window, so it surfaces as a `ghost_binding` audit issue; `/sync` (run directly or via its **Fix** button) closes and deletes it like any other ghost topic, regardless of the knob.

Session creation also owns an exact topic record, saved before the first remote request. That ownership protects the topic throughout slow startup and replacement; it does not expire while the creation task is running. Startup, periodic cleanup, and `/sync` recover abandoned creation records from current session presence and verify the recorded Telegram topic before restoring its binding. If that topic was deleted while its target remains alive, recovery creates a fresh topic without replacing another current binding for the target. Failed recreation attempts with a known outcome remain queued across restarts and respect Telegram rate limits.

A confirmed absent target can have its known topic cleaned up. An unknown target or an uncertain creation result without a new topic ID remains protected and appears as creation awaiting confirmation; CCGram does not guess whether the remote creation succeeded or repeat an ambiguous request. Targets belonging to a different backend are unverified, never treated as absent by the selected backend.

For a retired topic, cleanup calls `deleteForumTopic`. Deletion is irreversible and removes the topic history. If deletion fails, cleanup may close the topic as a fallback, but **closing leaves the topic visible and deletion pending**. Only successful deletion or a definitive already-gone response completes cleanup. Background cleanup retries up to 20 pending topics each minute; failures wait at least one minute and respect longer Telegram rate-limit delays. Ghost bindings are retired into pending cleanup before deletion, so failed requests remain recoverable.

The bot must be a group administrator with **Delete Messages** (`can_delete_messages`) to delete topics, and **Manage Topics** (`can_manage_topics`) to close them. See [BotFather Setup](#botfather-setup) and Telegram's [deleteForumTopic documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#deleteforumtopic). The report distinguishes deleted, already gone, closed with deletion pending, deferred, and protected outcomes. General/control topics are protected.

The Bot API cannot enumerate arbitrary topics. If an old topic's ID was already discarded from local state, `/sync` cannot discover it. Legacy bindings without a recorded chat ID are also left untouched: the same thread number in another incoming chat is not proof of ownership. Restore a known mapping or explicitly rebind before cleanup. Recovery of unknown topics requires an explicit list of topic IDs or a separate user-authorized Telegram client: MTProto's [messages.getForumTopics](https://core.telegram.org/method/messages.getForumTopics) can enumerate topics but is user-only. CCGram never guesses ownership from names or closed icons.

## Session Closure and Topic Deletion

CCGram distinguishes an idle agent from a closed terminal session:

- **Done agents with a live terminal** — The topic stays open and bound to its session. Finishing a task alone does not trigger deletion.
- **New terminal sessions** — CCGram creates a fresh topic instead of automatically reusing one from a previous session with the same name.
- **Closed terminal sessions** — CCGram rechecks that the terminal session is gone, then immediately attempts to delete its topic and history. There is no grace timer or recovery banner. This applies to tmux windows, Herdr session targets, and agterm sessions. An unavailable backend or a live session prevents deletion.
- **Sessions killed from the dashboard** — CCGram attempts topic deletion after the session is killed, with failed requests retained for retry.

Inactive terminal windows without a topic binding have a separate 30-minute cleanup timer. Disable that window cleanup with:

```bash
ccgram --unbound-window-ttl 0
```

## Multi-Instance Setup

Run multiple ccgram instances on the same machine, each owning a different Telegram group. All instances can share a single bot token. Because Telegram rate limits are token-wide, divide the expected aggregate traffic across instances; these processes do not share a rate-limit coordinator.

### Example: work + personal instances

Instance 1 (`~/.ccgram-work/.env`):

```ini
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=same_token_for_both
ALLOWED_USERS=123456789
CCGRAM_GROUP_ID=-1001111111111
CCGRAM_INSTANCE_NAME=work
CCGRAM_DIR=~/.ccgram-work
TMUX_SESSION_NAME=ccgram-work
```

Instance 2 (`~/.ccgram-personal/.env`):

```ini
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=same_token_for_both
ALLOWED_USERS=123456789
CCGRAM_GROUP_ID=-1002222222222
CCGRAM_INSTANCE_NAME=personal
CCGRAM_DIR=~/.ccgram-personal
TMUX_SESSION_NAME=ccgram-personal
```

Run both:

```bash
CCGRAM_DIR=~/.ccgram-work ccgram &
CCGRAM_DIR=~/.ccgram-personal ccgram &
```

Each instance uses a separate tmux session, config directory, and state. When `CCGRAM_GROUP_ID` is set, an instance silently ignores updates from other groups.

Without `CCGRAM_GROUP_ID`, a single instance processes all groups (the default).

> To find your group's chat ID, add [@RawDataBot](https://t.me/RawDataBot) to the group — it replies with the chat ID (a negative number like `-1001234567890`).

## Creating Sessions from the Terminal

Besides creating sessions through Telegram topics, you can create windows directly in your terminal multiplexer.

### tmux (default)

```bash
# Attach to the ccgram tmux session
tmux attach -t ccgram

# Create a new window for your project
tmux new-window -n myproject -c ~/Code/myproject

# Start any supported agent CLI
claude     # or: codex, gemini, pi
```

The window must be in the ccgram tmux session (configurable via `TMUX_SESSION_NAME`).

### herdr (`CCGRAM_MULTIPLEXER=herdr`)

Open a new herdr tab in the appropriate workspace, then start any supported agent CLI. CCGram discovers agent panes automatically; bare shell panes are not surfaced as topics (only active agent panes are).

### Multiplexer backends

For Claude, the SessionStart hook registers the session automatically. For Codex, Gemini, and Pi, CCGram auto-detects the provider from the running process name and discovers the session from transcript files on disk. In all cases, the bot creates a matching Telegram topic.

With agterm, open the session in the `ccgram` workspace (or a workspace listed in `CCGRAM_AGTERM_WORKSPACES`) and start a supported agent CLI. agterm reports the foreground command for active sessions; an idle shell has no foreground argv, so bare shell panes are not surfaced as topics.

This works even on a fresh instance with no existing topic bindings (cold-start).

## Session Recovery

When an agent session exits or crashes, the bot detects the dead window and offers recovery options via inline buttons:

- **Fresh** — Kill the old window, create a new one in the same directory
- **Continue** — Resume the last conversation (all providers support this)
- **Resume** — Browse and select a past session to resume from

The buttons shown adapt to each provider's capabilities. Claude and Antigravity support Fresh, Continue, and the CCGram Resume picker. Codex, Gemini, and Pi support Fresh and Continue; their CLIs can resume known session IDs, but CCGram does not yet enumerate those providers' sessions. Shell supports Fresh only because shell sessions are ephemeral.

## Manual Provider Override (`/agent`)

`/agent` (alias `/provider`) shows the topic name, provider, and Auto/Manual mode. A manual choice is accepted only when the recognized live foreground process matches that provider; unknown or mismatched processes leave routing unchanged. `/agent` does not start, stop, or redirect a process in the terminal.

Forms:

```text
/agent              # show picker (current marked ✓, with Auto/Manual mode)
/agent shell        # select Terminal only when a shell is running in the pane
/agent claude       # select Claude only when Claude is running (also: codex, gemini, pi)
/agent auto         # clear manual override and re-run auto-detection
```

A manual selection first checks that the live foreground matches the provider. It then reconciles the session-map entry against that destination: a matching entry is retained, a mismatched entry is dropped, and subsequent hooks from other providers are filtered. `/agent auto` checks and cleans the entry again before releasing the pin; if storage cannot be confirmed, it remains pinned. Old queued transcript content from another provider is discarded. Prompt-marker setup is offered only by backends that declare support; agterm does not because a shell builtin can be mistaken for a prompt.

Manual overrides set `WindowState.provider_manual_override=True`. The periodic auto-detection in `_detect_and_apply_provider` skips overridden windows until `/agent auto` clears the flag.

## Live View

Monitor agent terminal output in real-time via auto-refreshing screenshots in Telegram.

### How It Works

1. Tap the **Live** button in the action toolbar (or `/toolbar` → Live)
2. CCGram captures the terminal as a PNG and sends it as a photo
3. Every 5 seconds (configurable), it recaptures and edits the photo in-place
4. Content-hash gating: if nothing changed on screen, no API call is made
5. Auto-stops after 5 minutes (configurable) or when you tap **Stop**

### Configuration

| Setting           | Env Var                     | Default         |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- | --------------- |
| Refresh interval  | `CCGRAM_LIVE_VIEW_INTERVAL` | `5` (seconds)   |
| Auto-stop timeout | `CCGRAM_LIVE_VIEW_TIMEOUT`  | `300` (seconds) |

Both values are clamped to a minimum of 1 second.

## Screenshots

`/screenshot` (or the 📷 status-bar button) captures the current viewport of the bound tmux pane as a readable PNG with ANSI color.

Live view (auto-refreshing) uses the same viewport capture at a smaller font size for lower file sizes.

## Last Reply (`/last`)

`/last` (or the 📄 **Last** toolbar button) resends the most recent assistant reply to the current topic:

- **AI providers** (Claude, Codex, Gemini, Pi) — extracts contiguous assistant text blocks after the last user message from the session transcript. Falls back to the most recent assistant text if no turn boundary is found.
- **Shell** — captures scrollback and extracts the last command+output block between prompt markers.

Responses longer than 4096 characters are sent as a `.txt` document attachment instead of a text message.

## File Delivery (`/send`)

Send files from the bound window's working directory to Telegram. Three modes in one command:

```bash
/send docs/arch.png   # exact path → immediate upload
/send *.png           # glob → pick if multiple
/send arch            # substring search → pick if multiple
/send                 # no args → interactive directory browser at CWD
```

Security (project-scoped, deny-by-default):

- Resolved path must stay within window CWD (blocks `../` traversal and symlink escape)
- Hidden files/dirs (`.`-prefixed) denied
- Secret patterns denied: `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.p12`, `*credential*`, `*secret*`, `.env`, etc.
- If `.gitleaks.toml` exists, its `[[rules]]` path regexes are enforced
- Gitignored files denied (`git check-ignore` primary, `pathspec` fallback for non-git)
- 50 MB cap (Telegram bot API limit)
- Excluded dirs are never shown: `node_modules`, `__pycache__`, `.venv`, `dist`, `build`, etc.

Tunables: `CCGRAM_SEND_SEARCH_DEPTH` (default 5), `CCGRAM_SEND_MAX_RESULTS` (default 50).

## Action Toolbar (`/toolbar`)

`/toolbar` opens an inline keyboard of provider-specific tmux key actions. Row 1 is universal: `[📷 Screen, ⏹ Ctrl-C, 📺 Live]`. Row 2 varies per provider: Antigravity (Esc, Tab, Model), Claude (Mode, Think, Esc), Codex (Esc, Tab, Mode), Gemini (Mode, YOLO, Esc), Pi (Esc, Tab, π Model), Shell (Enter, EOF, Suspend). Antigravity/Claude/Codex/Gemini/Pi add a navigation row (Up, Enter, Down). The final row is `[📄 Last, Get File, Close]`; Shell folds Esc in: `[📄 Last, Get File, Esc, Close]`.

Toggle actions (Mode = Shift+Tab, Think = Tab, YOLO = Ctrl+Y) capture the pane ~250 ms after the key press and report the resulting mode-line in the toast (e.g., `auto-accept edits on`).

### Custom Toolbar

Place a TOML file at `~/.ccgram/toolbar.toml` (or set `CCGRAM_TOOLBAR_CONFIG=/path/to/file`). See `docs/examples/toolbar.toml` for a fully annotated example. Schema:

```toml
[actions.clear]                # define a custom action
emoji = "🧹"
text  = "Clear"
type  = "text"
payload = "/clear"

[providers.claude]             # override Claude's default grid
style = "emoji_text"           # emoji | text | emoji_text
buttons = [
  ["screen", "ctrlc", "live"],
  ["mode",   "think", "clear"],
  ["send",   "enter", "close"],
]
```

Action types:

- `key` — send a tmux key sequence (`"Tab"`, `"C-c"`, `'\x1b[Z'`). Set `literal=true` for raw byte sequences (TOML literal strings — single-quoted).
- `text` — send literal text + Enter (e.g. `"/clear"`, prompt templates).
- `builtin` — reserved (`screen`, `ctrlc`, `live`, `getfile`, `last`, `close`). Users cannot define new ones.

Action names must be ≤24 chars (callback_data budget). Providers absent from the TOML keep their built-in defaults. Malformed entries are logged and skipped — the loader never raises.

### Picker Hints

When you forward a slash command that opens a modal in-TUI picker (e.g. Claude `/model`, `/login`, `/theme`; Codex/Gemini `/model`; Pi `/model`), the topic reply adds a hint pointing at `/toolbar` to drive the picker with arrow keys. The hint adapts to your toolbar — if you removed Up/Down/Enter/Esc keys, the hint degrades to "Open /toolbar to drive the picker."

## Git Worktree Topics

When you create a new topic and pick a directory that's an **eligible git repo** (in-work-tree, not bare, on a named branch, no in-progress merge/rebase), an extra step appears between directory-confirm and provider-pick:

- **Use current branch** — original flow, no worktree.
- **New worktree** — suggests `ccg/<kebab(topic-title)>` (or `ccg/agent-<n>`) with branch+worktree collision avoidance. One-tap confirm, or send a text reply to edit the name.

Worktrees are created at `<repo>.worktrees/<slug>` via `git worktree add`. The agent launches rooted at the worktree path. A dirty source repo is allowed with a one-line warning. Branch-name validation runs through `git check-ref-format --branch`. Failure surfaces as a one-line error with a Cancel button.

Non-git directories see the unchanged flow — no warning, no extra step.

## Completion Summaries (LLM)

When an agent finishes (Stop event), ccgram waits up to ~3 s for the configured LLM to produce a single-line summary of what was accomplished, then edits the Ready message in-place with `Done — {summary}`. The static enriched Ready (task checklist + last status) appears immediately so you're never blocked on the LLM — the summary just upgrades it when it arrives.

When no LLM is configured (or it times out), the static Ready remains.

The LLM is the same backend used for shell command generation (`CCGRAM_LLM_PROVIDER`).

## Providers

CCGram supports Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Pi, and Shell. Each topic can use a different provider. See **[docs/providers.md](providers.md)** for full details on each provider, session modes, custom launch commands, LLM configuration, and provider-specific behavior.

## Data Storage

All state files live in `$CCGRAM_DIR` (`~/.ccgram/` by default):

| File                 | Description                                                       |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `state.json`         | Thread bindings, window states, display names, read offsets       |
| `session_map.json`   | Hook-generated window → session mappings                          |
| `events.jsonl`       | Append-only hook event log (read incrementally by monitor)        |
| `monitor_state.json` | Delivered transcript watermarks and pending Jump-to-live barriers |

Session transcripts are read from provider-specific locations (read-only): `~/.claude/projects/` (Claude), `~/.codex/sessions/` (Codex), `~/.gemini/tmp/` (Gemini), `~/.pi/agent/sessions/` (Pi). Shell has no transcript — output is captured directly from the tmux pane. The bot never writes to agent data directories; the delivered watermark records relay progress, not a mutation of the raw transcript.

## Running as a Service

For persistent operation, run ccgram as a systemd service or under a process manager:

```bash
# systemd user service (~/.config/systemd/user/ccgram.service)
[Unit]
Description=CCGram - Command & Control Bot for AI coding agents
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=%h/.local/bin/ccgram
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5
Environment=CCGRAM_DIR=%h/.ccgram

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

```bash
systemctl --user enable ccgram
systemctl --user start ccgram
```

ccgram retries brief Telegram polling conflicts for up to 90 seconds, which can
occur after a network reconnect. Persistent conflicts stop with a non-zero exit
so `Restart=on-failure` restarts the service. Check for another bot process that
uses the same token if the conflict returns.

On macOS, you can use a launchd plist or simply run in a detached tmux session:

```bash
tmux new-session -d -s ccgram-daemon 'ccgram'
```
