# Architecture Map

Authoritative module inventory is `/.claude/rules/architecture.md`. This file covers request/response lifecycles and the design constraints that must be preserved across changes.

## Request/Response Lifecycles

Inbound user message (Telegram → multiplexer):

1. PTB dispatcher routes through handlers wired in `handlers/registry.py`.
2. `handlers/text/text_handler.py` validates context and resolves topic binding.
3. `session.py` maps `(user_id, thread_id)` → `window_id`.
4. The multiplexer proxy sends keys to the mapped target. For Herdr, `multiplexer/herdr.py` reads `agent.list` immediately before dispatch, requires one matching opaque `herdr-session-v1-…` target, and uses that record's locator only for that action.

Shell provider (NL → command → shell):

1. `handlers/text/text_handler.py` detects shell-provider window, routes to `handlers/shell/shell_commands.py`.
2. `shell_commands.py` calls `llm/` to generate a suggested command.
3. Approval keyboard rendered; user confirms or cancels.
4. On approval, command sent via `tmux_manager.py`.
5. `handlers/shell/shell_capture.py` polls pane output and relays via in-place edits.

Voice message (voice → transcription → agent):

1. `handlers/voice/voice_handler.py` downloads audio, transcribes via `whisper/`.
2. Confirm/discard keyboard shown.
3. On confirm, `handlers/voice/voice_callbacks.py` checks provider:
   - Shell: routes transcribed text through `handlers/shell/shell_commands.py` (LLM → approval).
   - Other: sends directly to the tmux window.

Outbound agent output (provider transcript/event → Telegram):

1. `session_monitor.py` gets a fresh live-window listing and converges any uniquely attested identity aliases before reading hooks or loading the session-map delta.
2. It dispatches hook events only after convergence, then parses the reconciled session map and transcript updates while creating dependency-light receipts from `delivery_contract.py`.
3. Provider parser (`providers/*.py` + `transcript_parser.py` / `terminal_parser.py`) emits normalized updates.
4. `handlers/messaging_pipeline/message_queue.py` enforces ordering, merge rules, rate limits and settles the shared receipt contract. Worker takes a `TelegramClient`.
5. `handlers/messaging_pipeline/message_sender.py` delivers via the Protocol.

Screenshots (`/screenshot`, 📷 status-bar button):

1. `handlers/live/screenshot_callbacks.py` calls `last_unit.capture_for_screenshot(window_id)`.
2. `last_unit.py` calls `tmux_manager.capture_pane_scrollback()` (default 500 lines, `CCGRAM_SCREENSHOT_HISTORY`).
3. For shell topics, `last_unit.extract_last_shell_block()` slices the last command+output using prompt markers; other providers get full scrollback.
4. `screenshot.py` renders ANSI text to PNG; result sent as photo.

Live view (terminal → auto-refresh screenshots):

1. User taps Live in `handlers/live/screenshot_callbacks.py`.
2. `handlers/live/live_view.py` registers active view for the topic.
3. `handlers/polling/periodic_tasks.py` calls `live_view.tick_live_views()` every `config.live_view_interval` seconds.
4. Each tick captures the pane via `tmux_manager.py` (viewport only — unchanged from pre-scrollback), hashes content, edits via `editMessageMedia` only when changed.
5. Auto-stops after `config.live_view_timeout` or when user taps Stop.

Terminal closure and topic cleanup:

1. `handlers/polling/window_tick/apply.py` rechecks target presence and pending creation before retiring a dead binding.
2. `handlers/topics/topic_deletion.py` persists cleanup ownership and attempts immediate topic/history deletion. Failed deletion remains queued; `/sync` and periodic maintenance retry it. Unknown presence never proves closure.
3. `handlers/topics/topic_provisioning_recovery.py` recovers persisted creation records, verifies saved topics before binding, and retains recreation retries or unresolved remote outcomes. Active creation ownership has no age-based expiry.
4. Explicit recovery/resume UI remains in `handlers/recovery/`; automatic terminal closure deletes the topic instead of showing a recovery banner. New sessions never automatically reuse old topics by name.

Topic command panel (`/commands`):

1. `handlers/registry.py` dispatches to `handlers/commands/__init__.py:commands_command`.
2. `handlers/commands/panel.py` resolves the current topic binding and renders CCGram and provider actions as inline buttons.
3. Provider button labels and dispatch preserve the original provider command name. The callback rechecks user, chat, topic, window, and provider before dispatch.
4. CCGram actions use existing command handlers. Agent commands use `handlers/commands/forward.py`; failure probes and status snapshots remain in their existing modules.
5. `cc_commands.py` and `handlers/commands/menu_sync.py` keep Telegram's chat-level slash suggestions limited to shared controls. Telegram has no forum-topic command scope.

## Transcript Sources (read-only)

- Claude: `~/.claude/projects/`
- Codex: `~/.codex/sessions/`
- Gemini: `~/.gemini/tmp/<project-hash>/chats/*.jsonl` (CLI v0.40+; append-only JSONL, byte-offset incremental reads). Discovery matches by `projectHash` (or configured alias dir); no full-scan of unrelated project dirs.
- Pi: `~/.pi/agent/sessions/--<encoded-cwd>--/<timestamp>_<uuid>.jsonl` (JSONL v3; discovery matches the header `cwd` against the window cwd).
- Shell: no transcript files; output captured directly from the tmux pane by `handlers/shell/shell_capture.py`.

## Design Constraints to Preserve

- Tmux preserves the 1 topic = 1 window mapping keyed by tmux `window_id`. Herdr uses `agent.list` as the sole identity source and persists only opaque `herdr-session-v1-…` targets; never use a tab, pane, terminal, display, directory, or focus value as identity.
- Herdr guard failures (missing, duplicate, malformed, sessionless, or `legacy_herdr`) fail closed. A post-guard change before dispatch remains a documented possible-misdelivery race, not atomic delivery.
- A fresh live listing is the sole owner of identity-alias convergence. It folds only uniquely attested aliases and must run before hook-event consumption, because hook routing resolves only exact topic bindings; legacy aliases are migration evidence, never a second routing path.
- Monitor-cycle ordering is identity reconciliation → session-map re-read → hook-event dispatch → session-map/transcript work. Alias migration must precede consumption of an event whose canonical Herdr target replaced a bound target; the event offset advances only after that dispatch path runs.
- Transcript offsets are delivered watermarks, not queue-idleness snapshots. `delivery_contract.py` owns the dependency-light receipt/outcome model; the message queue settles it and the monitor persists only receipts settled as delivered or intentionally dropped, leaving failed receipt ranges replayable after restart. Core monitor code must not import handler implementations.
- No parse-layer truncation; splitting only at the Telegram send layer.
- Per-window provider behavior + capability-gated UI.
- tmux operations centralized in `tmux_manager.py`; no raw tmux shell calls in handlers.
- State mutations route through `session.py` + persistence helpers; no ad-hoc JSON writes.
- Handlers depend on `TelegramClient` Protocol. Runtime `from telegram.ext` allowed only in `bot.py`, `bootstrap.py`, `handlers/registry.py`, `telegram_client.py`, `telegram_request.py`, `telegram_sender.py`. Everything else uses `if TYPE_CHECKING:` for types.
- `SessionManager` constructs `WindowStateStore`, `ThreadRouter`, `UserPreferences`, `SessionMapSync` via constructor DI. Do not reintroduce `_wire_singletons` or `unwired_save`.
- Handler reads go through `window_query` / `session_query` or `window_state_ports/*`. Direct `session_manager.<attr>` in `handlers/**` is restricted to the write/admin allow-list (`set_window_provider`, `set_window_origin`, `set_window_approval_mode`, `set_window_worktree`, `cycle_*`, `audit_state`, `prune_*`, `sync_display_names`). Enforced by `tests/ccgram/test_query_layer_only_for_handlers.py`.
- Volatile live-session reads (task snapshot, wait header, has-snapshot, session-id, last-activity) go through `session_state_ports/live_session_state.py`. Direct handler imports of `get_claude_task_snapshot`, `get_claude_wait_header`, or `claude_task_state.has_snapshot` are banned. Write authority stays in `session_lifecycle`. Fitness gate: `tests/ccgram/test_session_state_ports_audit.py`.
- `WindowStateStore` is the only persisted window-state model. Feature-shaped reads and cohesive feature writes live in `src/ccgram/window_state_ports/{pane,identity,worktree,tool,lifecycle}_state.py`. Raw `WindowState`-field access in handlers, Mini App, or session_resolver/transcript_reader is rejected by `tests/ccgram/test_window_state_access_audit.py`. Provider identity writes still delegate to `SessionManager.set_window_provider`.
- `handlers/polling/polling_types.py` is pure (stdlib + `providers.base.StatusUpdate` only). `polling_state.py` owns strategies + module-level singletons. `decide.py` imports only from `polling_types`. Pinned by `tests/ccgram/handlers/polling/test_polling_types_purity.py`.
- The five polling strategies are bundled in `polling_runtime.PollingRuntime`. `get_default_runtime()` wraps the existing singletons (no new instances). `PollingRuntime.create()` builds an isolated bundle for tests. `tick_window`, `observe`, and `apply` accept `runtime: PollingRuntime | None = None`; callers that omit it use the default and are unaffected. Import direction: `polling_runtime` → `polling_state` only. Fitness gate: `tests/ccgram/handlers/polling/test_polling_runtime.py`.
- State-file contracts for `events.jsonl` and `session_map.json` are owned by `hooks/state_files.py`. All production writes route through `serialize_event_record` / `serialize_session_map_entry`; all production reads route through `parse_event_record` / `parse_session_map_entry`. File I/O, locking, and corrupt-file backup stay in `hook.py` and `session_map.py`. `hooks/state_files.py` is stdlib-only (no config, no providers, no I/O).
- In-function imports must carry `# Lazy: <reason>` (or live inside `if TYPE_CHECKING:` / `_reset_*_for_testing`). `make lint` runs `lint-lazy`.
- Ordering invariant: `bootstrap.wire_runtime_callbacks` must run before `bootstrap.start_session_monitor`. The monitor checks `_callbacks_wired` and raises if violated.
- Topic-creation seam: window creation state is consolidated in `handlers/topics/window_launch_service.py`. Callers build a `WindowLaunchRequest(user_id, thread_id, provider_name, cwd, mode, pending_text)` and call `launch_window(query, context, request) -> WindowLaunchResult`. Creation-flow key constants (`PENDING_THREAD_ID`, `PENDING_THREAD_TEXT`, `PENDING_WORKTREE_PATH`, etc.) are defined in `topic_creation_draft.py`; callers that access them via `context.user_data` must import only the constants from that module, not bypass the `launch_window` entry point. `TopicCreationDraft` exists in `topic_creation_draft.py` as a future accessor class but has no production callers yet.
- TranscriptParser delegation: `transcript_parser.py` delegates internally to `_handle_*` methods and tracks `_ParseState`; callers must not bypass the public `parse_entries` API.
