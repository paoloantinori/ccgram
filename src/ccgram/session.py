"""Claude Code session management — the core state hub.

Manages the key mappings:
  Window→Session (window_states): which Claude session_id a window holds (keyed by window_id).
  User→Thread→Window: delegated to ThreadRouter (see thread_router.py).

Responsibilities:
  - Persist/load state to ~/.ccgram/state.json.
  - Sync window↔session bindings from session_map.json (written by hook).
  - Resolve window IDs to ClaudeSession objects (JSONL file reading).
  - Delegate thread↔window routing to ThreadRouter.
  - Send keystrokes to tmux windows and retrieve message history.
  - Re-resolve stale window IDs on startup (tmux server restart recovery).

Key class: SessionManager (singleton instantiated as `session_manager`).
Thread routing: delegated to ThreadRouter (see thread_router.py) — no pass-throughs.
