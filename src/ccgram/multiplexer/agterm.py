"""agterm backend for the Multiplexer contract, via the agtermctl CLI/socket.

Anti-corruption layer over `agterm <https://github.com/umputun/agterm>`_'s
unix-socket control channel, driven through its ``agtermctl`` CLI. Every agterm
JSON shape (``tree`` / ``workspaces[]`` / ``sessions[]`` / ``surfaces[]``) and
every ``surface:<uuid>:<role>`` locator stays **private** to this module;
callers see only the neutral value types from ``multiplexer.base``.

Identity: the primary pane retains the session UUID as its ``window_id``.
A split peer gets a separate guarded target derived from its foreground argv.
Hidden splits are included. The peer target is refused after closure, promotion
or a change to its argv; it never falls back to the primary pane.

The backend shells out to ``agtermctl`` (the seam explicitly allows a CLI in
place of speaking the socket directly); the socket path is passed through
``--socket``. The command runner is injectable so unit tests feed JSON fixtures
without a live socket and the constructor stays I/O-free.

Two agterm behaviours drive the shape of this adapter:

* **Read and write default to different panes.** ``session text`` with no
  ``--pane`` reads the visible or focused pane, while ``session type`` with no
  ``--pane`` injects into the main pane. Every capture and injection below
  therefore passes an explicit role and never relies on a default. The agent
  target carries the explicit role for both reads and writes.
* **A split pane has no atomically guarded input API.** Split targets are
  checked against live argv before each operation, including the separate
  Return injection. A topology change between that check and the RPC remains
  a race; native token-addressed input is the upgrade path. An identical argv
  restart is the same target. Split targets cannot close or rename the shared
  session. ``split_window`` and raw sibling handles remain unsupported.

Capabilities: agterm reports native agent status and supports workspace selection.
It does not use the guarded topic-target flow because its session UUID is already
its durable target. ``exposes_pane_tty`` is False (agterm reports foreground argv,
no tty or pid), ``read_max_lines`` is None (``session text --lines N`` takes any N),
and ``supports_event_stream`` is False (the control channel has no event subscription).

        None whenever agterm cannot report an argv, which is several states and
        not one: a shell holds the pane, there is no foreground pid, the

        prompt" (confirmed by agterm's author, umputun/agterm#508; their godoc
        named only the shell case and has been corrected).

        The shell provider does not work on this backend, and a shell name
        would not fix it. agterm 0.25 adds ``foregroundShell`` for the case
        where a recognised shell holds the pane, but a shell builtin such as
        ``read`` or ``vared``, and a shell loop, run inside the shell process,
        so argv stays the shell's: a pane blocked on input is indistinguishable
        from one at a prompt and both report the same name. Installing a prompt
        marker on that signal would type into a running ``read``.

        The provider detector classifies this argv directly because agterm cannot
        provide a process-group ID. This preserves provider detection behind
        wrappers such as ``node``, ``bun``, and ``npx``.
