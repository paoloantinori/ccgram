"""Backend-neutral push-updated agent-status cache.

The herdr event-stream consumer writes the latest native ``AgentStatus`` per
window here; the status-polling layer (``observe._native_agent_status``) reads
it synchronously instead of forking a ``herdr`` subprocess every tick. This
bridges the push stream and the existing poll loop (the "augment" reconcile):
push keeps the cache fresh, the poll reads it, and a one-shot subprocess
``agent_status()`` is the cold-cache fallback.

Depends on the seam proxy (never a concrete backend), so the polling layer
can import it without crossing the F1 boundary (mirrors
``multiplexer.vim_state``). All access is from the single asyncio event-loop
thread, so a plain dict suffices.
