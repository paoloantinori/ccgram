"""Backend-neutral hook identity resolver.

The Claude Code hook runs as a separate process spawned inside a multiplexer
pane; it cannot import bot config or wire the ``multiplexer`` proxy. It only
needs to answer "which window am I?" from the environment. Each backend exposes
that differently — tmux via ``$TMUX_PANE`` + ``tmux display-message``, herdr via
``$HERDR_PANE_ID``, agterm via ``$AGTERM_SESSION_ID`` — so this module picks the
backend by which ``self_identify_env`` variable is present (never a ``name ==
"<backend>"`` conditional) and returns a neutral ``SelfIdentity``.

The tmux probe (a ``display-message`` subprocess) is injected as ``tmux_query``
so this module stays I/O-free and table-testable; the hook supplies its own
``_resolve_window_id`` as the default probe. The herdr branch resolves the
``(workspace_id, pane_id)`` locator through an injected ``herdr_query``. It
never falls back to a pane or tab identifier: absent, missing, or ambiguous
live records cause the hook to skip its write.

    Dispatches on which backend's ``self_identify_env`` var is present:
    ``$TMUX_PANE`` → tmux (via ``tmux_query``), ``$HERDR_PANE_ID`` → herdr.
    Returns None when none is set or the tmux probe fails (today's
    "cannot determine window" path).

    The order is fixed: tmux, then herdr, then agterm. It is a precedence list,
    not a rule about which multiplexer is innermost. tmux is first because it
    is the established path and a herdr pane inside a tmux pane reports the
    tmux identity. agterm is last because its variable is the least specific
    evidence of anything: every shell agterm spawns inherits
    ``AGTERM_SESSION_ID``, including one running a nested tmux or herdr, so
    checking it earlier would claim panes owned by the inner multiplexer.

    For herdr: ``herdr_query(workspace_id, pane_id)`` resolves the exact live
    locator to a guarded session target, so ``session_window_key`` becomes
    ``herdr:<opaque-target-id>``. Returns None when either locator component is
    unavailable or the probe has zero or multiple matches; the hook then skips
    the session_map write rather than recording a location as identity.
