"""Silent delivery-wedge early warning.

The 2026-09-26 incident (TASK-43) froze delivery for seven hours with
zero log lines; the operator noticed only because replies stopped
arriving. This watch turns that failure mode into a five-minute alarm:
it compares each bound window's durable delivery watermark (the
monitor's settled-receipt boundary) against its transcript size, and
when a large gap stops advancing it warns in the journal and posts ONE
notice in the topic. The notice is sent through the direct interactive
path, never the delivery queue: a wedged queue must not swallow its
own alarm.

The watermark is the correct signal, not the user read offset: the
read offset stamps at enqueue time and on /history paging, so it keeps
moving while delivery is dead (message_routing.py routes and stamps
even when the worker is frozen). The watermark freezes precisely
because receipts stop settling.
