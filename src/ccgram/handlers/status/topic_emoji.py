"""Topic emoji status updates via editForumTopic.

Updates topic names with status emoji prefixes to reflect session state:
  - Active (working): topic name prefixed with working emoji
  - Idle (waiting): topic name prefixed with idle emoji
  - Done (Claude exited): topic name prefixed with done emoji
  - Dead (window gone): topic name prefixed with dead emoji

Tracks per-topic state to avoid redundant API calls. Debounces transitions
to prevent rapid active/idle toggling from flooding the chat with rename
messages. Spaces renames of different topics in a chat by a minimum
interval (poll path defers, /sync sleeps it out) and pauses a chat's
renames entirely for a cooldown after flood control (#199). Gracefully
degrades when the bot lacks editForumTopic permission.

Key functions:
  - update_topic_emoji: Update emoji for a specific topic (debounced)
  - clear_topic_emoji_state: Clean up tracking for a topic
